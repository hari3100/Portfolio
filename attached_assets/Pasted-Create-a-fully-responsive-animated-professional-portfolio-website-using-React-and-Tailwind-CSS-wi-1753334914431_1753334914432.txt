Create a fully responsive, animated, professional portfolio website using React and Tailwind CSS, with the following pages and features:

🔷 Pages:
1. **Home / Landing Page** – Rich design, smooth animations using Framer Motion, professional layout. Include a headline, short bio, dark/light mode toggle, and animated skill tags (e.g. Python, ML, GenAI, AWS, etc.).
2. **About Me** – Includes full name (Aniket Dattaram Desai), career path as an emerging data scientist/ML engineer, education history, a timeline view of roles, certifications (AWS ML, IBM, SQL, etc.), and skills.
3. **Projects** – Auto-fetch public GitHub repositories from GitHub user `Aniket-desai-24`. Each repo should be displayed as a card with:
    - Project name
    - Image (default thumbnail or custom)
    - "Show More" button → opens a modal or new route with detailed description.
    - Placeholder for owner-uploaded media (images or videos), visible only to Aniket when logged in (admin-only upload panel).
4. **Blog** – Optional blog section with stylish blog cards. Blog content can be hardcoded in markdown format or static files.
5. **Contact** – Simple contact form (name, email, message) + social links (LinkedIn, GitHub, Email).

🔄 Auto Sync GitHub:
- Use GitHub API to fetch project info dynamically.
- Each new repo created on GitHub should automatically reflect on the portfolio.

🔐 Admin Upload Feature:
- Allow project-specific image or video uploads from the owner (Aniket). Use secure local storage or a simple upload route with password protection (or placeholder auth).

💡 Technologies to use:
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion (for page and element transitions)
- GitHub API (for fetching repos)
- React Router (for navigation)
- Optional: Firebase/Auth or basic password auth for owner access

🌓 Dark/Light mode toggle should be included across the site.

📱 Design must be fully responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile views.

🎯 Final Goal:
Make this a professional, stylish, highly interactive personal portfolio that stands out visually and technically, with an enriched and animated UI.
