I want to redesign my existing 5-page website (Home, About, Projects, Blog, Contact) without altering the core functionalities or structure. However, I want a complete visual and experiential overhaul that feels modern, elegant, and cohesive across all pages—not just the homepage.

Design Goals:
Consistent Theming Across Pages:

Ensure all pages follow the same design language, spacing system, and typography.

Avoid inconsistent layouts or style mismatches between pages.

Dark Mode / Light Mode Compatibility:

Design should support theme toggling (light/dark mode) using CSS variables or prefers-color-scheme.

Text and background colors should always maintain strong contrast ratios for readability.

Avoid text colors blending into backgrounds in either theme.

UI/UX Upgrade (without logic changes):

Keep all existing functionality, routing, and content structure intact.

Improve the visual hierarchy, margins, padding, and element alignment.

Apply modern UI elements like smooth animations, hover effects, micro-interactions, and responsive grids/flex layouts.

Typography & Color Palette:

Use clean, legible fonts (e.g., Inter, Open Sans, Poppins, etc.).

Incorporate a refined color palette with elegant accent colors that complement both themes.

Avoid harsh tones; keep the visual tone professional yet inviting.

Hero Section on Homepage:

The homepage contains my name and a subtitle/descriptor.

Enhance this section with a subtle animated background that is:

Not overwhelming or too bright.

Optionally includes interactive particle or motion effects that respond to cursor movement.

Fully responsive and doesn’t impact performance.

Classic + Modern Aesthetic Fusion:

Blend classic design principles (balance, alignment, consistent UI spacing) with modern aesthetics like neumorphism, glassmorphism, or clean card-based layouts.

Mobile and Accessibility:

Ensure responsive design for all viewports.

Follow accessibility best practices (contrast, alt texts, keyboard navigation).

Final Note:
I want the final website to feel completely refreshed visually but without disrupting the underlying navigation, interactivity, or content structure. Prioritize user experience, clean visuals, and a polished interface that reflects thoughtful design across all five pages.
