I want to make the following structural and visual updates to the About page, with clear changes to layout and component behavior ‚Äî please ensure that the layout remains responsive, consistent in styling, and user-friendly.

üßπ Section Removal:
Completely remove the Professional Journey, Experience, and Expertise section along with its description paragraph ("With over 1.5 years...").

This is redundant and already covered in detail within the Professional Background section.

üîÑ Section Rearrangement:
As the top section (Professional Journey) is removed, the first visible element on the page should now be the intro paragraph (starts with "Passionate about AI...").

Directly under that, the Professional Background section will appear on the left, and the Career Journey section should now appear on the right (swap positions with Education and Certification).

üîß Professional Background Section:
Retain all content inside this section.

Convert the content into a scrollable container, same as the styling and behavior of the Education and Certification section.

Use the same fixed height and scrollbar behavior (auto-scroll on overflow, hidden scrollbar if possible).

üîÅ Career Journey Section:
Just swap places with Education ‚Äî move it above the Education and Certification section.

No content changes needed.

üß± Technical Expertise Section:
This section currently extends vertically without bounds as more skills are added ‚Äî refactor it to avoid overwhelming the layout.

‚úÖ Required Changes:
Wrap the entire Technical Expertise content inside a fixed-height scrollable block, again matching the height/style of Education and Certification.

Display skill categories (Programming, AI Tools, etc.) in a two-column layout inside the scrollable area.

Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for the column layout.

If layout appears too crowded or unbalanced, fallback to showing only 3 skill categories at a time, with the rest scrollable below.

Ensure that each category heading (e.g., "Programming") has its list items indented or styled cleanly underneath.

Avoid awkward spacing or alignment issues.

Maintain clean padding/margin between categories.

üé® Visual Consistency:
All scrollable blocks (Professional Background, Technical Expertise, Education & Certification) must:

Have the same fixed height

Share similar padding, background, border-radius, and font sizing

Scroll only when content exceeds block height (overflow-y: auto)

Final Layout Structure (Top to Bottom):

1. Intro Paragraph ("Passionate about AI...")
2. Left: Professional Background (scrollable)
   Right: Career Journey
3. Education & Certification (moved below the Career Journey)
4. Technical Expertise (scrollable, two-column below the  Professional Background)
